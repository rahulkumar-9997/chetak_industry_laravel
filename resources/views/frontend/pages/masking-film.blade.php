                                        <h2>Masking Film / Guard Film</h2>

                                        Advantages of Masking Film are as follows
                                        </h4>
                                        <ul class="list-style-one">

                                            Applying protective film to a surface when the substrate is clean and free of dust, dirt, oil and damage helps keep the item in that state, even if environmental conditions threaten to cause harm. This may mean applying film to keep UV rays from discoloring plastic stored outside, or using clear surface protection film to ensure appliances reach buyers in perfect condition.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                            The cost-effectiveness of protective film comes from the fact that a dirty or otherwise damaged item may need expensive repairs or replacements, raising headaches for manufacturers, shippers, installers, or all the above. The investment in buying and applying surface protection film is a form of insurance against the eventual costs of damage.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                            The actual application of surface protection film is quick and easy and can be carried out by hand, just unroll the film from a custom-width roll and smooth it onto the substrate.
